# stm32f103c8t6
Having fun with openOCD, an ST-Link V2 and a stm32f103c8t6 dev board (STM32_Smart v2.0)

This projekt is based on [rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki/Programming-an-STM32F103XXX-with-a-generic-%22ST-Link-V2%22-programmer-from-Linux)

This is what to do. See results in the [wiki](https://github.com/leakim/stm32f103c8t6/wiki) 

```
cd src
sudo cp stm32.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo apt-get update
make install # will install correct gcc-arm-none-eabi
make git
make maple-mini
make ocd
```

and in a second terminal

```
cd src
make cli
**> reset halt**
...
**> dump_image dump.bin 0x8000000 0x1ffff**
...
**> flash write_image erase maple_mini_boot20.bin 0x08000000**
...
**> reset run**
> exit
```
